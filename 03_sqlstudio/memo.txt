SQL to check FlightDate:

with tab1 as (
  SELECT 
    FlightDate, 
    parse_date('%F', FORMAT('%s-%02d-%02d', YEAR, CAST(MONTH AS INT64), CAST(DayofMonth AS INT64))) as mydate
  FROM `mikan-mochi.kura.flights_raw`
)
select *
from tab1
WHERE FlightDate <> mydate
LIMIT 5


SQL tocheck Reporting_Airline
(Table Explorer is not available now.)

SELECT 
  distinct Reporting_Airline, DOT_ID_Reporting_Airline, IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline
#  distinct Reporting_Airline 
# distinct DOT_ID_Reporting_Airline
#distinct IATA_CODE_Reporting_Airline
FROM `mikan-mochi.kura.flights_raw` 
 LIMIT 100
